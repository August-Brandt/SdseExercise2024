# README

Hello there!

This is the repository where your SDSE TA's will upload any code seen during exercise livecoding sessions!

Do you have questions regarding the exercises, lectures or the course in general?

Feel free to ask them using the Q&A forum on the SDSE course page.


# Upcoming structure

When more livecoding sessions occur, we will restructure this repo's code into folders per livecoding session and make a table for overview.

E.g:

| Week no. | Code contents |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | linkedlist |
| 5 | someExercise |
